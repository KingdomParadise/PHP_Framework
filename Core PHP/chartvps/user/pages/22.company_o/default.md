The idea behind AgileVPS came about when we realized that the virtual private server (VPS) market was super polarized: you had the choice between cheap providers, which often proved unreliable or expensive ones that offered decent service but at a punishing premium, preventing clients from affording all but a few months of service. Our mission quickly became clear - to fill that gap with reliable VPS service that people can afford. We believe VPS technology can and will replace your desktop and laptop, allowing you to perform demanding operations from any mobile device. In essence you are computing in the cloud.</p>

<p><span>Our core philosophy is fairness in everything we do: the service we provide to our clients, how we treat our employees, and social as well as environmental responsibilities.</span>We also call this symbiotic business, where all participants of a transaction benefit. We curb our profit margins to make our VPS service approachable to everyone because our aspiration is not to become the richest tech company but the most human one. To us ethics take priority over profits. Our employees are based in Canada, are compensated at twice the minimum wage or more, and enjoy benefits and respect that every human being deserves to have.</p>

<p><span>Every enterprise leaves a footprint, and we believe that transparency and taking responsibility are cornerstones of doing good business.</span>We know servers eat a lot of power, which ultimately produces carbon emissions. To reduce our carbon footprint we donate 2% of all profits to efficiently-run environmental organizations, such as Rainforest Action Network, The Orangutan Project, and Friends of the Earth, whose mission is to protect and replenish forests - lungs of Earth, and home to millions of species.</p>
