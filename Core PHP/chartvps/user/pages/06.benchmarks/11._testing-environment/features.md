    <h3>Benchmarking Environment</h3><div class="pad1rem">

<div>
      <p>All benchmark tests were performed using Passmark, the industry standard software for objectively measuring performance of computer hardware. Two benchmarks were completed:</p>
      <ul><li>The first compared each ChartVPS plan to all tests ever performed, representing all of the world's computers.</li>
       <li>The second compared each ChartVPS plan to peer devices, those computers within the performance range of the plan being tested. Peer comparison gives audience a sense of familiarity - the kind of performance they can expect if a VPS plan were a physical computer.</li></ul></div>     
<div class="key-features"><h4>Hardware Testing Methodology</h4>
<p></p>
      <div>
        <div>Each VPS plan had individual hardware components tested in specific scenarios, representing different real-world applications, in order to test for comprehensiveness and avoid bias. Listed below are the hardware we benchmarked and associated tests:</div>
       <ul>
          <li>Processor (CPU)
              <ul><li>Single-Threaded Performance (applications utilizing a single core)</li>
                <li>Multi-Threaded Performance (applications capable of parallel processing, making use of multiple cores, such as TradeStation and MultiCharts)</li>
                <li>Mathematical operations, compression, encryption, physics</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Memory (RAM)
              <ul><li>Speed of Reading and Writing across different file sizes</li>
                <li>Latency</li>
                <li>Responsiveness with various memory loads</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Storage (SSD)
              <ul><li>Speed of Reading and Writing across different file sizes</li>
                <li>Seeking within disk files</li>
                <li>Responsiveness with various memory loads</li>
                <li>Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Graphics (2D)
              <ul><li>Speed of rendering graphical user interface (GUI) elements</li>
                <li>Rendering of vectors, bitmaps, and text</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
      </div></div>
<div class="key-features"><h4>Network & Latency</h4>
  <div>Network, including latency and speed of connection, was tested outside Passmark via multi-locational ping from our VPS to popular brokers (Interactive Brokers, TradeStation, etc.) and exchanges, to provide a more relevant guide of what traders can expect when placing orders. A few remarks:
<ul><li>Standard, Personal, Scalper, Quant VPS plans, located in our new Philadelphia data center, had an average latency of 5ms to most popular exchanges and area brokers, namely those in vicinity of NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, CBOT.</li>
<li>Daytrader, Professional, Institutional VPS plans give subscriber choice of location, meaning you could set-up your server in financial hubs like New York City and Chicago, further reducing latency to the industry-leading 1ms.</li>
<li>Note: while important, network latency should not be the main focus when looking for a reliable trading server. Equally (and sometimes more) important, is computer's ability to perform calculations quickly, in parallel, and with stability - in other words, slow computer with 1ms latency executes orders with a greater delay than fast computer with 10ms latency. Unless you trade nanosecond-sensitive strategies, like arbitrage, as long as your latency is under 50ms, you can expect immediate fills, even for high frequency trading strategies like scalping.
