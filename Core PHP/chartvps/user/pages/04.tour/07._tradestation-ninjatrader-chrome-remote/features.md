      <p>Trade locally and remotely, by running one platform on your physical PC and another on a ChartVPS server. In this example we're accomplishing that by using the Chrome Remote Desktop app for the Google Chrome browser to access Ninjatrader on a ChartVPS server, while simultaneously running TradeStation locally. If you do not use Google Chrome but want browser access to your server see the Web Remote Desktop example below. ChartVPS is fully compatible with the Chrome Remote Desktop, app and protocol.</p>
