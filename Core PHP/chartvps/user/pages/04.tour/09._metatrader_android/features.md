      <p>Just like iOS, Google's Android-powered devices are also fully compatible with all ChartVPS plans. In the example below, we're using an Android-powered tablet to remote connect and trade Metatrader 4 (MT4) located on our ChartVPS server. Both, Metatrader 4 and 5 are fully compatible with our hardware.</p>
