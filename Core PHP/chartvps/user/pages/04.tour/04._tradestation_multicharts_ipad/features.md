      <p>Use any iOS device to connect to our servers, and enjoy the same smooth remote desktop experience you get with a desktop connection. In the example below, we're connecting to a ChartVPS remote server via iPad. TradeStation and MultiCharts both run smoothly and responsively, even when used simultaneously, since all data processing is done on the server side.</p>
