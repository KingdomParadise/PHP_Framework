      <p>If you don't have access to a Remote Desktop app, we offer the Web Remote Desktop facility that you can use to access your server via any modern browser. In this example, we're accessing TradeStation on our ChartVPS server via Chrome browser (any modern browser, such as Safari, FireFox, Edge, Opera, etc. works) - efficiency and technologies behind the HTML5 standard ensure that performance is comparable to a native Remote Desktop app.</p>
