      <p>Connecting to our Windows-based VPS from a Mac OS device (10.5 and higher) is as simple and as fast as using Windows itself. Enter the address, username, and password, and enjoy native-like performance you'd expect from using Windows. You can even select the screen size for your VPS portal.</p>
