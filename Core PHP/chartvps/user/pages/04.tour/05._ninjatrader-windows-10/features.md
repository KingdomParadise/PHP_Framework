    <div class="page-content"><h3>NinjaTrader on Local PC + ChartVPS, Simultaneous Discretionary + Automated Trading</h3>
      <p>Since ChartVPS incorporates multiple Internet providers, guaranteeing 100% uptime, you can reliably automate your strategies on the VPS, while still doing discretionary trading on your local PC. In the example below, we're using NinjaTrader with Kinetick data feed to accomplish this task - the Remote Desktop window (in the foreground) accesses NinjaTrader hosted on a ChartVPS server with strategy automation in place, while trader is free to pursue manual trading on their local Windows 10 PC.</p>
