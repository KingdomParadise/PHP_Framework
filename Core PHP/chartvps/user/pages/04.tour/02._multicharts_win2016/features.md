      <p>We'll start with the most common scenario: connecting to your ChartVPS Virtual Private Server (VPS) or dedicated server via Windows's built-in Remote Desktop Connection - available in all versions of Windows operating system, including 10, 8, 7, XP. In the example below, we're using Windows 10 to connect to MultiCharts, located on a ChartVPS server. What you see in the open window below is MultiCharts, but on the remote server (VPS or dedicated), not your local desktop. If you're not familiar with VPS (Virtual Private Server) technology, you can think of it as your fully functional remote computer, accessible from any device.</p>
