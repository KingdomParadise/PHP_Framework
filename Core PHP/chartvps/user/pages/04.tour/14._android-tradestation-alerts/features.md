      <p>Many of our clients use ChartVPS as a remote trading or signal server that they can access via mobile device on the go. Thanks to the powerful hardware in each server, in addition to ChartVPS's Internet backbone redundancy networks, platforms remain online 24/7, ensuring each automated trade rule is executed and every signal forwarded to clients' mobile device or email. Most common uses for our servers include automated trading, changing indicator/strategy settings on the go (as shown in the example below), and receiving alerts in real-time, using email, visual, push-to-phone, and audio notifications.</p>
