      <p>Anything you do on your local computer can be done on your ChartVPS server via Remote Desktop, on the go and from any device. This also includes development of custom indicators. In the example below, we're using an iPhone (landscape orientation) to access EasyLanguage Development Environment and modify code for TradeStation's Volume Weighted Moving Average indicator add-on.</p>
