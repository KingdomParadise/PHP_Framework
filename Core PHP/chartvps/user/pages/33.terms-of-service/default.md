Transmitting, Storage, or Distribution of any information, data or material in violation of American and Canada's Federal, State, Provincial and local regulation or law, or by the common law, is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to copyright, trademark, trade secret, or any other statue. ChartVPS reserves the right to remove the infringing data from its server along with the account at our discretion. ChartVPS strictly forbids anyone using our servers to distribute, store or transmit obscene or pornographic material, or any other material which ChartVPS determines unacceptable.

######Ethical E-mail Usage (SPAM)
Unsolicited commercial advertisements are not allowed in e-mail, and will likely result in account suspension or cancellation. Commercial advertisements are unwelcome in most Usenet discussion groups and on most email mailing lists. Inappropriate posting may result in account suspension or cancellation.

See the newsgroup or mailing list's charter for whether advertising is allowed or not. "Spamming," or sending a message to many different off-topic newsgroups, is particularly unethical and will be treated as such.

Sending a message, especially an advertisement, to more than five or six recipients, is by itself spamming unless the individuals have specifically requested to be added to a mailing list on that topic. E-mail is a person-to-person medium, not a broadcast medium. Upon your first Spam offense your mail will be disabled for 72 hours.

Upon your second Spam offense your entire domain will be disabled for 72 hours and you will be fined $200.00 per sent Spam. Upon your third offense your account with ChartVPS will be terminated, you will be fined $500.00 per sent Spam. No refunds will be given if your account is terminated for Spam. Adult Content:
