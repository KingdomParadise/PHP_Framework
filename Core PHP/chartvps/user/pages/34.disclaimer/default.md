##Trading involves risk

######Using Servers
ChartVPS Technologies is not responsible for any losses that you may incur while using ChartVPS services (Standard VPS, Personal VPS, Scalper VPS, Daytrader VPS, Professional VPS, Institutional VPS, Quant VPS, Dedicated Personal, Dedicated Ultra, Trader's Toolbox). Thanks to multiple Internet backbone connections, our uptime track record is industry-leading, real 99.99% (circa 1999). However, on rare occasions, just like any other Internet provider, we experience short periods of downtime. These mostly occur when the technical issue is on the Internet backbone level - primary Internet infrastructure that we peer. ChartVPS is not responsible for any losses you may incur as result of any downtime.

ChartVPS is not responsible for any losses you may incur as result of damage to our hardware or datacenters. Again, this is an extremely unlikely event, but we have to mention it - like everyone else - for legal reasons.

When trading, you should consider using protective stops (take-profit, stop-loss) as contingencies against rare events such as disconnections and disasters.

######Using Trader's Toolbox
All ChartVPS subscribers have access to Trader's Toolbox, a collection of software tools which also include platform add-ons intended for chart analysis. These are informational tools and as such ChartVPS is not responsible for any losses you may incur by using them in your trading endeavors.

######Trading Futures, Stocks, Forex, Options - Risk Disclosure
Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones’ financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The highly leveraged nature of forex, futures, and options offers especially large potential rewards, but also equally large potential risk. Again, do not trade with capital you cannot afford to lose. Do not over-leverage your accounts, and try to keep them under 50:1.

No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on mnikolic.com and any of the product's promotional pages. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results.

CFTC RULE 4.41 – Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.
