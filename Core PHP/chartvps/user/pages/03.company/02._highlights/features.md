          <h4><strong><i class="fas fa-server"></i> ChartVPS Overdrive Technology</strong></h4>
<p>Every plan includes ChartVPS Overdrive<sup>TM</sup>, a load balancing technology that provides sustained maximum CPU output when traders need it. We know periods such as market opens and news can increase chart activity by several orders of magnitude, and Overdrive ensures your server is ready to handle it. During these periods of market volatility server's processor (CPU) will rapidly ramp up and run at maximum power for as long as needed. With ChartVPS an advertised CPU speed of 3.8GHz really means 3.8GHz - these computational resources are reserved for your server and are never shared.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
